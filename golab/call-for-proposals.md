### Event Description


GoLab is a comprehensive conference on Go programming that started in 2015, organized by developers for developers.
Since 2022, we have held GoLab and RustLab as a co-located conference, but this year they are back-to-back with a 1-day overlap.
It is organized by Develer, a software company based in Florence, Italy.

GoLab will be an **in-person event**. In this edition you will find talks and workshops.

We'll have two types of talks, a shorter one, the **25 min Discovery** talk, and a longer one, the **40 min Deep-dive** talk.

The Discovery talk is for the speaker who has found something cool and wants to share it with the world and inspire other developers.

Instead, the Deep-dive talk is intended to present and explain a topic in which the speaker is an expert. 

The workshops are 3 hours long and focus on practical case studies.

### Call for Proposals

GoLab is a comprehensive conference on the Go programming language, established in 2015 and organized by Develer, a software company based in Florence, Italy. Designed by developers for developers, GoLab brings together experts and enthusiasts to share knowledge and innovation.

GoLab will be an in-person event. In this edition you will find talks and workshops.


## Talks

Talks will last 45 minutes and can either present and explain a topic of expertise or showcase something innovative to inspire other developers.
They are structured in 30 mins talk + 10 additional minutes for a Q/A session + 5 minutes to switch rooms. Speakers can modify the ratio between the talk and the Q/A session as they like. 

## Workshops
Workshops can be 3 or 6 hours long, focusing on practical case studies in an interactive format.


## Topics

GoLab is receptive to proposals on any Go-related subject matter, including but not limited to cloud computing, networking, programming languages, ecosystems, devices, platforms, and security. Additionally, we encourage submissions that span multiple topics.

Even if your talk is not strictly Go-related, we encourage you to submit it. We welcome challenging and unconventional proposals!


### CFP Notes

## Language

All presentations will be in English.

## Content Guidelines

We would like our speakers to present **original content**. If your talk has been presented at another conference, please indicate this in your submission.

We expect a common baseline of respectful tone from everyone (see the Code of Conduct for more details).

Presenters can include a company logo **on the introduction slide only**. Talks about commercial products are allowed as long as they focus on the technical aspect.
If you would like to speak about your company's product with more freedom, please consider giving a **sponsored talk**. You can contact us for more information at sponsors@golab.io.

Given that we have only one slot per day allocated for sponsored talks, please consider that the likelihood of your sponsored talk being featured on the schedule is lower than that of a regular talk.

We welcome first-time speakers

In the coming months, we will offer weekly online office hours for all accepted speakers, where you can talk to us and ask your questions directly.

We will offer 1 to 1 rehearsals, either online or in person at the Develer offices (Calenzano, near Florence), where you can practice your talk and get suggestions.

After you have sent your proposal

We'll review your proposal as soon as possible and give you some feedback.


## General advice

GoLab receives a lot of proposals, so the team must make a choice. We will review the proposals based on the selection criteria below, please ensure your talk or workshop meet all of them. 

Write a presentation that is long enough to let us understand what’s the goal you want to achieve with the talk, that you have real practical experience on the topic, that you discovered new things that are valuable to share with the community. Moreover please ensure your proposal matches the conference topics and that you’re able to present your talk in the given time slot.

A typical structure of your proposal may be:

_[title/outline]_
Please not too long: it would be nice if it could fit in a tweet.
Remember also that the schedule should be readable on smartphones too.

_[kind of session]_
The kind of session your presentation can apply to (choose among talk, half-day workshop or whole-day workshop)

_[level]_
Please specify the level of the audience your presentation is addressed to (choose from Introductory and Overview, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert)

_[abstract]_
This is how your session will be described to the attendees in our schedule. So please be concise on what you are talking about but also try to spice up the interest of your audience by giving them evaluable reasons to attend your presentation.

In case you are making a proposal for a workshop, you may want to specify some technical requirements that your audience should meet to ensure a satisfying experience, such as some devices (a laptop) or a certain version of some software installed on their computer.


## Ticketing

If you submit a talk or workshop proposal you will be allowed to get your ticket at Early Bird price. In case your proposal may be rejected, we will send you a **discount code to get a Regular ticket for the price of an Early Bird one**. Please make sure to **purchase your ticket before the Regular fare deadline** (September 15th, 2025, at 12 PM, CET) otherwise the discount code won’t apply properly!




## **IMPORTANT: Visa documentation**

According to the Italian Laws, **we are not authorized to produce a document in support of people requesting a business visa for coming to speak to our conferences**. You must request a simple touristic visa and the only document we can produce in support is a declaration you will attend our conference and you will stay in the venue hotel in the conference period.
Please check if you can get your visa in your country in time for the conference before submitting your proposal.


## Benefits for speakers

If your talk is accepted, congrats: you will be officially a GoLab 2026 speaker! 

This grants you a free **Premium ticket** for the GoLab conference as well as for RustLab (free access to all talks and workshops) and free access to the social dinner.

Plus, we also offer a room at the Grand Hotel Mediterraneo (GoLab’s venue) for all the conference duration (2 nights for talks, 3 nights for workshops presenters).

We regret that **we can only cover accommodation**; travel expenses are not reimbursed.

Let's have a great conference together!
